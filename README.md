## Appendix: Physical Modeling

### High-Level Overview

Our model combines Copernicus NOx measurements with wind data to identify and quantify pollution sources. The process works as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: We start with a raster of NO2 concentrations from satellite observations and corresponding wind vector data (speed and direction) for each pixel.

2. **Flux Calculation**: By multiplying the NO2 concentration with the wind vector, we calculate a flux map showing the movement of NO2 across the area.

3. **Divergence Analysis**: The core of our method lies in calculating the divergence of this flux. Divergence measures the net outflow of NO2 from each pixel. A positive divergence indicates a source, as more NO2 is flowing out than in.

4. **Source Identification**: To identify and quantify emissions from specific sources like power plants, we analyze the divergence patterns. Strong positive divergence peaks often correspond to point sources.

5. **Emission Quantification**: We use an iterative peak fitting algorithm to quantify emissions from these peaks.

### Technical Details

Our model calculates NOx flux using the following equation:

```
F = L*V*w

Where:
F = NOx flux
L = NOx/NO2 ratio
V = NO2 tropospheric column
w = wind fields
```

Emissions are calculated as:

```
E = D + S = ‚àá(L*V*w) + L*V/œÑ

Where:
E = Emissions
D = Divergence of flux
S = Sinks
œÑ = Time constant for NOx degradation
```

Key features:
- Point source localization accuracy: < 2km
- Emissions uncertainty: 42-65%
- Detection limit: 0.03-0.11 kg/s
- Cloud data fraction threshold: 30%
