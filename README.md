Emisat: Innovative NOx Emission Reporting

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) from the European Union is set to impact nearly 50,000 companies across the EU, mandating comprehensive disclosure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts. This new standard requires reporting on how activities affect climate, human rights, and pollution.

At Emisat, we focus on providing cheap, fast, and scalable NOx emission reporting for specific locations. Our innovative approach adresses the issue of costly on-site measurements and imprecise satellite data, offering a solution that's both accurate and accessible.

Through Emisat's services, companies can transition from reactive to proactive environmental management, ensuring compliance with CSRD and contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future.



üõ∞Ô∏è EU space technologies
Emisat harnesses the power of EU space technologies and geospatial data by using Sentinel-5P NRTI NO2 and Global Forecast System wind data. We combine these datasets using state-of-the-art physical modeling approaches based on scientifical research. We provide high-resolution NOx emission estimates with improved spatial granularity compared to current methods. We leverage the solution proposed by Beirle, S., Borger, C., et al. (2019). ‚ÄúPinpointing nitrogen oxide emissions from space.‚Äù.

Our innovative use of satellite measurements and wind data allows us to pinpoint specific emission sources like power plants, rather than just measuring raw NO2 levels. We also propose to track impact of this pollution on nearby communities.



‚õëÔ∏è Emisat directly addresses the following challenge:
Challenge #1: Emissions and carbon footprint reporting

Emisat provides an effective solution for carbon accounting and reporting by:

Offering precise NOx emission reporting, a crucial component of overall carbon footprint.
Using European space data from Copernicus (Sentinel-5P).
Enabling companies to track and manage their emissions effectively, fostering accountability and promoting sustainability.
Supporting compliance with CSRD and other environmental regulations.
Contributing to the collective effort to mitigate climate change through better emission monitoring and management.

Appendix: physical modelling
Our model combines knowledge from top-down emission maps with wind fields from ECMWF, to average horizontal fluxes of NO2 which preserve strong gradients at point sources.

The NOx flux is given by: F = L*V*w

Where L is NOx divided by NO2, V corresponds to NO2 tropospheric column and w corresponds to wind fields

The divergence of the flux yields to emissions (E) and sinks (S), from continuity equation at steady state: D = E - S

We can describe the sinks by a 1st order time constant: S = L*V/œÑ, where œÑ is the time constant for the degradation of NOx gas. 

Emissions are calculated as follows: E = D + S = ‚àá(L*V*w) + L*V/œÑ

As divergence is a linear operator, the mean emission is determined by the temporal mean sinks and the divergence of the temporal mean flux.

Thanks to the divergence method and by applying a peak fitting algorithm , we can provide a clear localisation of point sources (e.g., power plants, cement plants) with an accuracy below 2km.

Emissions uncertainty due to V, L and œÑ uncertainties in optimal conditions is 42% (detection limit: 0.03 kg/s), while it can go up to 65% in case of lower sensitivity and sample sizes (detection limit: 0.11 kg/s). Measurements with cloud data fraction above 30% were skipped.
